Project’s overall judgement 

This was a success project and it was able to analyze the accurate behaviour of employee leaving due to gender. The idea of team work, R to perform the statistical analysis, and GitHub version control helped to facilitate the working process. The project has improved technical and teamwork skills which led to a holistic report that is data driven.

Conclusions
The Chi-square test indicated significant relationship between the gender of the employees and equipment leaving behaviour (). The count that was observed showed 884 females left and 716 males left although there were lower females in the workforce. Row and column totals were used to compute the expected frequencies, and the contingency table made it easier to analyze the table. These findings indicate that gender correlates with leaving chances, with the female having higher tendencies to employment in the organization.
