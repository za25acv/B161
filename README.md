Computation Using Formula

The formula is:

 

For Male, Stayed:

 

For Male, Left:

 

For Female, Stayed:

 



For Female, Left:

 

		

The null hypothesis is rejected /not rejected based on the p-value 

The Chi-square statistic:

χ2=∑(O-E)2/E

χ2=227.81



Degree of freedom is:

df=(2-1)(2-1)=1 

p-value: p < 0.0001 

 

The p-value is much less than 0.05 and we reject the null hypothesis. Gender and leaving of employees are statistically significantly related. The observed counts show that females have higher chances of leaving than males.

Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis (H0/H1) 

Null hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in the proportions of leavers between males and females.

Alternative hypothesis (H1): There is a difference in the proportions of leavers between males and females.


Project’s overall judgement 

This was a success project and it was able to analyze the accurate behaviour of employee leaving due to gender. The idea of team work, R to perform the statistical analysis, and GitHub version control helped to facilitate the working process. The project has improved technical and teamwork skills which led to a holistic report that is data driven.

Conclusions
The Chi-square test indicated significant relationship between the gender of the employees and equipment leaving behaviour (). The count that was observed showed 884 females left and 716 males left although there were lower females in the workforce. Row and column totals were used to compute the expected frequencies, and the contingency table made it easier to analyze the table. These findings indicate that gender correlates with leaving chances, with the female having higher tendencies to employment in the organization.
